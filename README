Dependences
===========

There are no dependences.

One can use gmpy setting GMP = 1 in src/domains.py,
but usually the pure Python version is faster
(dup_permanental_minor_poly(m, QQ) is faster with gmpy).


Usage
=====

>>> from hobj import dup_matching_generating_poly, dup_independence_polynomial
>>> from graphs_gen import dict_fuller
>>> d = dict_fuller(60)
>>> dup_matching_generating_poly(d, val=1)
1417036634543488
>>> dup_independence_poly(d, val=1)
217727997152

It can be used in Sage:
sage: from hobj import dup_matching_generating_poly
sage: g = graphs.PetersenGraph()
sage: d = g.to_dictionary()
sage: g.matching_polynomial()
x^10 - 15*x^8 + 75*x^6 - 145*x^4 + 90*x^2 - 6
sage: dup_matching_generating_poly(d)
[6, 90, 145, 75, 15, 1]


Notes
=====

The code is organized in a way to be easily included in Sympy.
Eventually hobj.py will appear in a Pull Request for inclusion in Sympy.

Release history:

Version 0.1 released on June 2014
